          Aside from the ever-improving and changing hardware landscape in
          technology, there is also a movement to improve the way those devices
          are coded. As of 2019, Google has made Kotlin the official program
          language for Android.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve used an Android application made after the change, you’ve
          likely been running Kotlin developed applications without even
          noticing. That’s because this switch is for developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people are familiar with the term ‘Java’, even if only by name.
          It was released in 1995 as the backend programming language for web
          applications, games, audio, and video. It became so popular that it
          sprouted sub-languages and prompted operating system developers to
          include a virtual machine specifically for reading and running
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kotlin was designed to provide a better experience for developers and
          end-users by preventing common problems without changing
          compatibility. Java was the first full feature programming language to
          take over running the internet. Being among the first of anything in
          software development leads to unintentional problems down the road.
          Kotlin was designed around common flaws in the Java structure to
          remove some of those unintentional problems. Part of the reason no one
          noticed the change as an Android user is that Kotlin compiles to the
          same base code that can be read by the Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)
          installed in modern devices. This allows developers to switch from
          Java to Kotlin easily.

        <header>Difference Java Kotlin</header>
        <ul>
          <li>Speed of coding</li>
          <p>
            Kotlin and Java provide almost the same speed for coding. However,
            Kotlin has more laconic constructions, which allow a developer to
            type less. Finding a solution to a task requires more time than with
            Java, which means that the language has a higher cognitive load. For
            an abstract thinker, Kotlin is an ideal choice. Java has more coding
            processes than Kotlin. Because of this, a coder needs to spend less
            time thinking of a solution. As the difference in coding speed
            between these languages is not sizable, the verdict for Kotlin vs
            Java on this segment is a draw.
          </p>
          <li>Performance</li>
          <p>
            As both Kotlin and Java compile to ByteCode (which runs on JVM) it
            is a daunting task to compare them when it comes to memory usage.
            Hence, measuring, tracking, and comparing their performance is hard.
            Kotlin is more functional than Java, due to its extra features. It
            is also easier to work with multithreading apps due to Kotlin’s
            Coroutines tool. Yet, the language compiles and executes a little
            slower than Java, which is mainly due to the extensive number of
            features. On the other hand, Java is simple, and has fewer extra
            features than Kotlin, thus compiling faster. As the difference is
            slight, the battle of Kotlin vs Java based on performance is also a
            draw.
          </p>
          <li>Stability</li>
          <p>
            Stability is one parameter where we can find a notable difference
            between the languages. Java is a programming language that has been
            in the development scenario for quite a long time. The language
            provides long-term support for versions like Java 8 and Java 11,
            which means that if anything goes wrong with these versions,
            developers will fix it with a patch. A coder can download various
            versions of Java with a free license. Though Kotlin is also an
            established language, it is still younger than Java. The language
            has no versions with long-term support. Though both Java and Kotlin
            are considered stable languages, Java ultimately wins the battle of
            stability.
          </p>
          <li>Documentation</li>
          <p>
            Though both languages have plenty of documentation to learn, it is
            easier to find a tutorial or a book for Java as it has been in use
            for a longer time. Java is often considered to be the most
            straightforward programming language to learn, and one can find
            official documentation from Oracle. On the other hand, though a
            comparatively young language, I believe Kotlin’s official
            documentation is sufficient to learn how to work with it, so this
            battle too ends in a draw.
          </p>
          <li>Popularity</li>
          <p>
            According to Google Trends, Java tickles the interest of developers
            more than Kotlin. Though Java has gone through a few ups and downs,
            the popularity of the language stays ahead of Kotlin by a long
            distance. One of the major reasons for this is the longer life of
            Java. Java’s need for fewer cognitive investments in learning is
            also another crucial reason. Because of this, the battle for
            popularity goes to Java.

      <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing Kotlin, Open IDE and write your first
          "Hello World" Kotlin code:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
  fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
  }
        </pre
          >
        </code>
        <p>This is different from Java which writes the code like this</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
  public class ProgramHelloWorld {
      public static void main (String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
      }
  }
          </pre>
        </code>
      </section>

      <section id="Tipe_Data" class="main-section">
        <header>Tipe Data</header>
        <p>For Example</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
  fun main() {
    val myNum: Int = 2                // Int
    val myDoubleNum: Double = 5.09    // Double
    println(myNum)
    println(myDoubleNum)
  }            
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>Output:<br />2<br />5.09</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
  fun main() {
    val myLetter: Char = 'Y'          // Char
    val myBoolean: Boolean = true     // Boolean
    val myText: String = "Future"     // String
    println(myLetter)
    println(myBoolean)
    println(myText)
  }            
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>Output:<br />y<br />true<br />Future</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          Read-only local variables are defined using the keyword val. They can
          be assigned a value only once.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
  val a: Int = 1  // immediate assignment
  val b = 2   // `Int` type is inferred
  var x = 5 // `Int` type is inferred
  c = 3       // deferred assignment
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>var mutable = can edit || val immutable = can't edit</p>
      </section>

      <section id="String_Tempelates" class="main-section">
        <header>String Tempelates</header>
        <code>
          <pre>
  var a = 1
  // simple name in template:
  val s1 = "a is $a" 

  a = 2
  // arbitrary expression in template:
  val s2 = "${s1.replace("is", "was")}, but now is $a"
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          The String template is the same as the String data type, which
          represents data in the form of text / textual. String templates
          introduced by ES6 use template strings by providing a back-tick(` `)
          to a data.
